above is an interactive map with the nodes after Haiti's earthquake in 2010


medical items:

Insulin
Glucagon	(Treatment of hypoglycaemia)
Salbutamol inhaler	(Treatment of acute asthmatic attack )
Medical gas mixture of 50% nitrous oxide and 50% oxygen (Pain relief in emergency rescue situations)
Glycerol trinitrate	(Treatment of severe angina attack )


Higher scale concerns:

How do we get the data?
Texts
drone data collection
social media natural languge processing
HAM radio for emergency communicaitons?

How do we move the supplies?
Drone supply drop
cyclists
ideally trucks

How can we use the data?

Identify dead zones that need more resources due to transit issues
Identify what supplies are needed most and where in real time
Adapt the nodes to a distribution problem. (Future implementation)


Individual Emergencies:
Drones can identify individual emergencies if the individuals cannot reach a node
Otherwise, node communication can quickly identify the areas that require high emergency medical response


OUTPUT: 
Map of demand to change incoming supplies
Map of problem areas (hot spots) where more personell are required
	This output can be adapted to an optimal path clear problem
